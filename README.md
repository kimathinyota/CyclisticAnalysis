# CyclisticAnalysis

As a capstone project to earn the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I created a report in R analysing the data (and detailing my approach) for a given (fictional) company.

Goal: Using generated data for a fictional bike-share company, Cyclistics, to: investigate the differences between members and casual riders in their usage of Cyclistic bikes to better understand how to convert casual riders into members.

[Summary report can be viewed here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kimathinyota/CyclisticAnalysis/blob/main/CyclisticsFindings.html )
